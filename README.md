[Still A Work of Art](https://still-a-work-of-art.netlify.app/) is a minimalistic web application designed to provide artists with inspiration without any distractions. Whether youâ€™re looking for a spark of creativity or simply want to explore new visual ideas, this web app is here to help.

## Features

- **Clutter-Free Interface**: Focus on the art without any unnecessary distractions.
- **Randomized Inspiration**: Generate a new picture with a single click.
- **One Click, One Chance**: Once a new picture is generated by clicking the "Try another Picture" button, there is no way to return to the previous picture. Each click offers a unique chance for inspiration, so choose wisely!
- **Category-Based Selection**: Choose from various categories to tailor the inspiration to your needs.
  
## Usage Instructions

1. **Generate a Random Picture**:
    - Click the "Try another Picture" button to load a random picture.
  
2. **Category Selection**:
    - Below the "Try another Picture" button, there are 7 tags: 
      - Landscapes
      - People
      - Food
      - Animals
      - Experimental
      - Architecture
      - Still Life
    - By default, all tags are selected, allowing a wide variety of pictures to be shown.
    - Deselect the categories you are not interested in by clicking on the corresponding tags, then apply the tags. Your preferences will be saved for next time as well!
    - Only pictures from the selected categories will appear when you generate a new picture.
    - Please Note: Selecting multiple categories **does not generate pictures that combine these categories**; it randomly selects from the pool of all pictures in the selected categories.
